# Overview

This project will help you find repositories on GitHub. Create a group of repositories you are interested in, the service will find users who put a star on them, and then select and rank repositories that are also interesting to those users. This can be useful when searching for repositories on a specific topic of interest to you (especially if the topic is very narrow): find a few, and the service will find the rest for you. I felt the need for this service when I was looking for new articles, datasets, and repositories for a specific computer vision problem.

If you do not want to use the whole service, but only the scripts for searching repositories, check [tasks.py](/recommendations/tasks.py) and [github_gql_queries.py](/recommendations/github_gql_queries.py).
