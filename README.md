# Overview

GHREC simlifies the search for repositories on GitHub. Create a group of repositories you are interested in, the service will find users who have starred them, and then pick and rank repositories that have also been starred by those users. This can be useful when searching for repositories on a specific topic of interest to you (especially if the topic is very narrow): find a few, the rest will be found for you. I felt the need for this project when I was looking for new articles, datasets, and repositories for a specific problem in computer vision.

If you do not want to use the whole service, but only the scripts for searching repositories, check [tasks.py](/recommendations/tasks.py) and [github_gql_queries.py](/recommendations/github_gql_queries.py).
